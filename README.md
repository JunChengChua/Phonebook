# Phonebook

## 1. Steps Required For Running Program

- Once you have cloned this repository, type 'npm install' into the repository to download the necessary libraries.
- You should be able to run the program by typing 'npm run test'.
- Then you need your own PostgreSQL database which you must start running separately. Make sure to connect to that database from server.js before running the server.
- You then need to start the server by opening another terminal and entering the command 'node server.js'.
- The Phonebook should be fully functional locally!
